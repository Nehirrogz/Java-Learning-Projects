## Project Details

### 1. ATM Application
This project simulates basic banking operations.
* **Key Concepts:** `Scanner`, `do-while` loops, input validation.
* **Logic:** Prevents withdrawing more money than the current balance.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
A fun algorithm practice using random number generation.
* **Key Concepts:** `Math.random()`, infinite `while` loops, counters.
* **Logic:** The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number, giving "Higher/Lower" hints.
