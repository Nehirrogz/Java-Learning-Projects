## Project Details

### 1. ATM Application
This project simulates basic banking operations.
* **Key Concepts:** `Scanner`, `do-while` loops, input validation.
* **Logic:** Prevents withdrawing more money than the current balance.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
A fun algorithm practice using random number generation.
* **Key Concepts:** `Math.random()`, infinite `while` loops, counters.
* **Logic:** The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number, giving "Higher/Lower" hints.

### 3. Geometric Calculator
This project simulates a menu-driven calculator, focusing on combining control structures with mathematical functions.
* **Key Concepts:** `while` loop (menu), `switch/case`, `Math.pow()`, `Math.sqrt()`, `continue`, `break` (loop control).
* **Logic:** The main `while` loop keeps the program running until the user selects 'Exit'. Inside the `switch`, it performs two main tasks: (1) Hypotenuse calculation using the `Math` class, and (2) Filtering odd numbers using a `for` loop combined with `continue` (to skip odds).
